## What are your first reactions, thoughts, and feelings about what you just saw?

At the beginning of the video I was a little confused about the purpose of the research, but after a few minutes I realized it was a total disaster. It really bothers me that the scientist put aside his human sensibility to achieve a scientific or personal goal. it's hard to say but it just goes to show that when humans are put in an extreme situation we lose all our humanity and turn into animals, this fact is more than proven along the history, so They did it for nothing, am very sad for it.

## How did resocialization occur?

All the characters experienced a resocialization in themselves, but I think it is more marked on the prisoners. The prisoners forgot about the investigation when one of them came back saying that he could not get out. they started to feel new sensations and hatred towards the guards. at the moment they started to accept the repression, they stripped themselves of the right to be well treated, they were acquiring a new way of life, that of a prisoner. In the same way, when the one who decides to quit  talked to the psychologist, we can see how he felt like a real prisoner.

## Why this is an example of total institution?

This is an example of a total institution because the prisoners were controlled by the guards and were completely isolated from society. The guards governed the lives of the prisoners and when one of them did not do what they said they would punish him. The goal of a total institution is resocialization and that is what happened with the college students who played the role of prisoners, they changed their personality to that of a prisoner; and some of the guards became sadistic.

## What are other examples of a total institutions, and what can we learn about them from this  experiment?
